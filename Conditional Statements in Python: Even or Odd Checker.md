# 1(a) Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker

## Aim
write a python program to find the minimum of two float numbers using conditional expression (Ternary)

## Algorithm
1.Start

2.Read two float numbers a and b from the user

3.Use the conditional expression:

4.If a < b, then minimum = a

5.Else minimum = b

6.Display the minimum value

7.End

## Program
```
a = float(input(""))
b = float(input(""))

minimum = a if a < b else b

print(f"The minimum of {a} and {b} is {minimum}")
```
